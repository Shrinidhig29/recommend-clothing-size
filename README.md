Project Overview
Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical to improve customers’ shopping experiences and reduce product return rates. However, modelling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products and imbalanced label distribution (most of the feedbacks are "Fit").
